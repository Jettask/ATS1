						<h3>Inside information&nbsp;</h3>
	  	              <p> The current situation up to now is that we have three locations.&nbsp;</p>
	  	              <p>This year we acquired one additional company in Bradford with approximately 120 employees out of which 80 are working in production and 40 employees are in management and administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The main location of the company remains in Bath with approximately 420 employees out of which 70  are employed in management, administration, marketing, sales and R&amp;D.</p>
		  	          <p>&nbsp;Next to those there are two more locations, one in Bolton with approximately 200 employees with 40  in management and administration and a smaller branch in Norwich specialized for custom made products. With approximately 60 employees out of which 43 are working in production and 17 are employed in management, administration and R&amp;D.</p>
		  	          <p>&nbsp;All branch offices use  local providers of IT services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last two years ATS has moved toward the hybrid workspace, especially for R&amp;D and HR departments. The majority of employees from  management and administration departments during the last 2 years found themselves working from home.&nbsp;</p>
		  	          <p>To cover the needs of remote and office workers during the pandemic we integrated MS Office 365. We started using MS Teams for meetings with great success.&nbsp;</p>
		  	          <p>Due to this success, we have moved the majority of our support business to Microsoft Azure.&nbsp;</p>
		  	          <p>Due to our exposure to industrial espionage and theft of intellectual property, we are seriously concerned about security beyond the usual level.</p>
                      <p> Therefore, we are interested in any solution that would increase our security and&nbsp;alleviate our consern. We are looking for a solution to handle sensitive electronic documents between sites, such as:&nbsp; invoices, plans, designs and HR documents.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;We are also in need of a more reliable central solution for printer/PC management. We have a typical MPS office use model, (click on printer/pc estate for more information). </p>
                      <p>&nbsp;Having paid for devices we didn't use during the pandemic we don't wish to have this problem again e.g MPS,desktops, etc.</p>
                      <p>We are looking for lessons learned from covid to what we can to digitalize. </p>
